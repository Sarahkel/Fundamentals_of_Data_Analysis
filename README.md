## Problem statement

1. Explain the background to the dataset â€“ who created it, when it was created, and
any speculation you can find regarding how it might have been created.
2. Plot the interesting aspects of the dataset.
3. Calculate the descriptive statistics of the variables in the dataset.
4. Explain why the dataset is interesting, referring to the plots and statistics above.

## How to run the notebook

Please find the project [here](https://github.com/Sarahkel/Fundamentals_of_Data_Analysis/blob/master/Anscombe-Quartett%20Assignment.ipynb) under "Anscombe-Quartett Assignment.ipynb" and run from top to bottom. As all the package imports are done in the first cell of code it is crucial to have this run. Also, it is possible that cells built on variables defined in previous code cells.

References can be found at the end of each section and are marked [n].
